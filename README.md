If You Want to publish A blog then U can add the route /compose or https://blogs-me7b.onrender.com/compose to navigate to publish page Where you can add title and content . Once published it will redirect to home page with the published page . It will not store the published page longer since database is not integrated to it . It will hold as long as the server is not down by default.


This page is Built using node.js , express.js and EJS . Since database is not yet added to the app it will restore only the Deafult content and cannot hold the published page much longer
